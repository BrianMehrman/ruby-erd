# RubyErd

RubyErd is a gem meant to walk the classes and modules in your projects creating a GraphViz diagram.
The RubyErd gem can be used with a single ruby file or a ruby project like rails.
This project was heavily influenced by [RailRoady](https://github.com/preston/railroady).

The end goal of this gem is to provide more utility to the RailRoady gem to create
an ERD that not only provides the ActiveRecord associations but also any modules
and class that are deeply nested.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
